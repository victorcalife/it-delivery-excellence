## 🔍 Problem Management Workflow

1. **Detection**  
   - Recurring incidents flagged by monitoring, NOC, or service desk  
   - Identified during weekly service health reviews or trend reports  

2. **Logging**  
   - Problem record created and classified (infra, app, process, etc.)  
   - Priority defined based on impact and frequency  

3. **Analysis**  
   - Root Cause Analysis (RCA) using methods like 5 Whys or Fishbone  
   - Involve SMEs from cross-functional teams  

4. **Workaround / Resolution**  
   - Define workaround for known errors (if permanent fix not yet available)  
   - Document Known Error Database (KEDB)  

5. **Change Implementation**  
   - Raise RFCs when resolution requires change control  
   - Track deployment and validate impact  

6. **Closure**  
   - Validate resolution effectiveness  
   - Update documentation and share learnings
